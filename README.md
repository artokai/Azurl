# Azurl
A simple and lightweight, No-DB Url-redirection service controlled by a GitHub repository

__NOTE:__

As of 2017-01-14 I'm currently using even more lightweight solution to power my personal url redirection service. It's a very simple Node.js server which gets automatically redeployed by Azure everytime I make changes to the configuration file in GitHub.
